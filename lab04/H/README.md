# Problem H: Kth Longest Length

Time Limit: 1 Sec  Memory Limit: 128 MB

## Description

Giving you three integers: n, m, k and a sequence {a_n}. The elements in {a_n} are distinct. Please find the longest continuous subsequence whose kth smallest element is as large as possible. And the subsequenceâ€™s length is larger than or equal to m. Please print the length of the subsequence.

## Input

The first line is an integer T, which is the number of test cases. (1 <= T <= 10)

Each test case begins with three integers, n, m and k. (1 <= n <= 300000, 1 <= k <= m <= n)

Then n integers represent the elements in {a_n}. (1 <= ai <= 10^7)

## Output

An integer for each test case, the length problem required.

## Sample Input
