Time Limit: 1 Sec  Memory Limit: 128 MB

## Description

Giving you N distinct numbers and inserting them into a list one by one. Now ItakEjgo wants to know the median of each odd step. The median is the middle number after sort the numbers.

## Input

The first line will be an integer T(1 <= T <= 10), which is the number of test cases.

For each test case, the first will be an integer n. Then there will be n integers, a[i].

( 1 <= n <= 1000, 0 <= a[i] <= 10000)


## Output

For each test case, output the median for each odd step in a line.

## Sample Input

```
2
5
1 3 2 4 5
7
1 7 2 8 9 3 6
```

## Sample Output

```
