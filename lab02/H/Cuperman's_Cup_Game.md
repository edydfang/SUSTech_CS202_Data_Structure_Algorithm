### Problem H: Cupermanâ€™s Cup Game

Time Limit: 1 Sec  Memory Limit: 128 MB

#### Description

Cuperman has two cups `A` and `B`. There are `x` balls in `A`, `y` balls in `B`. You can move balls between these two cups. The number of balls can be moved from `A` to `B` (or from `B` to `A`) is equal to the number of balls in `B` (or in `A`). For example, if A has 3 balls and B has 2 balls, you only can move 2 balls from `A` to `B`, but cannot move 2 balls from `B` to `A`. Now Cuperman wants to know, how many move steps he need to obtain one empty cup.


#### Input

The first line will be an integer `T` (T <= 10^5), which is the number of test cases.

For each test case, you will be given two integers `x` and `y`. (0 <= x, y <= 100000)

#### Output


For each test case, output the number problem required. If you can't make any cup empty, output `-1`.
